"""
main.py — AI Radio Echo
Full pipeline orchestrator.

Usage:
    python main.py [--env {local,prod-db,prod-models,production}] [--dry-run]

Steps:
  1.  Fetch news (skipped in dry-run)
  2.  Generate broadcast script (stub in dry-run)
  3.  Generate TTS audio per segment
  4.  Concatenate segments with FFmpeg
  5.  Check audio duration — exit 1 if below env threshold
  6.  Generate cover image
  7.  Compile MP4 — exit 1 if file missing or empty
  8.  Upload to YouTube (mocked unless env=production and not dry-run)
  9.  Save episode to DB (skipped in dry-run)
  10. Sync config.js

Environment is ONLY set via --env. Never inferred from any env variable.
